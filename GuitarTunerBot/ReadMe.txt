Built for Bot Framework 3.x in 2018 so things will definitely be outdated.

Welcome to my voice activated Guitar Tuner project. This uses Azure, LUIS, and Bot Framework to enable Cortana to understand the 6 strings of the guitar and play the frequency.

1. Update keys with your own. 
	a. LUIS Model
	b. Bot AppId

2. Build and update via latest Bot Framework, there may be a ton of breaking changes.

3. Try with emulator or webchat via text or cortana via voice.

Note: The main dialog is RootLuisDialog.cs, AppId is configured in Web.config.
